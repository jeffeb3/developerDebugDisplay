* Install:

We depend on qt and osg (and on a couple of boost modules for the test apps):
> sudo apt-get install qt4-dev-tools libopenscenegraph-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-filesystem-dev

To build the main test app we also require opencv to load an image (you might want to just get opencv-dev)
> sudo apt-get install libopencv-core-dev libopencv-highgui-dev

Once those are installed, just run
> scons -j<numProcessors> libs
> scons -j<numProcessors> apps

To build the tests, run
> scons -j<numProcessors> tests

To build it all, run
> scons -j<numProcessors> all
