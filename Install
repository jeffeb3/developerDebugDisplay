* Install:

We depend on qt and osg (and on a couple of boost modules for the test apps):
> sudo apt-get install qt4-dev-tools libopenscenegraph-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-filesystem-dev

Once those are installed, build the lib and apps by running
> scons -j<numProcessors> libs
> scons -j<numProcessors> apps

To build the tests, run
> scons -j<numProcessors> tests

To build it all, run
> scons -j<numProcessors> all
